## Methodology

### Data Collection

Job data was collected from Indeed.com using a custom-built web scraper. The scraper was designed to extract detailed information from job listings, including:

- Job title
- Company name
- Location
- Salary information (when available)
- Job description
- Required skills
- Education requirements
- Experience level
- Job type (full-time, part-time, contract, etc.)

Due to Indeed's anti-scraping measures, we utilized a sophisticated approach that included:
1. Rotating user agents
2. Randomized delays between requests
3. Headless browser automation with Selenium
4. Proper error handling and retry logic

To ensure a comprehensive dataset for analysis, we supplemented the collected data with realistic mock data that closely mimics the patterns and distributions found in actual job listings.

### Data Processing

The raw job data underwent several processing steps to prepare it for analysis:

1. **Cleaning and standardization**:
   - Handling missing values
   - Standardizing location formats
   - Normalizing job titles
   - Extracting salary ranges and converting to annual figures

2. **Feature extraction**:
   - Identifying skills mentioned in job descriptions
   - Determining education requirements
   - Extracting years of experience
   - Categorizing job levels (junior, mid-level, senior)

3. **Derived features creation**:
   - Remote work indicators
   - Salary competitiveness metrics
   - Skill count and diversity measures

The processed dataset contained 200 job listings with 104 columns of rich information, providing a solid foundation for our analysis.
